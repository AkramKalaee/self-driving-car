# Self Driving Car  

This repo contains all the code for the self-driving RC car that I am making as part of the
[#100DaysOfMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) challenge. Follow
my progress at [my personal website](https://sagnibak.github.io/) where I am logging milestones
of this project and also presenting all the information with enough detail to allow anyone to
follow along if they want.
